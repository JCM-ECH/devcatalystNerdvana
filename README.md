nerdvana website design
Our website is based on a store called Nerdvana. We chose this website because we all enjoy games. We chose the colors of our website because we equally like blue. The font though, was randomly selected because we didn't see any fonts that we took intrest in. The pictures we selected were chosen from top played and best rated games of 2017. The accessories we selected were also chosen from best rated headphones. We chose more modern day game systems because we didn't want to use retro systems.  The design was simply a group thought process. We all were confused on how we should do it but at the end we came to a consensus of our design.
